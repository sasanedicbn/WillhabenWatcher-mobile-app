## Public Cloud Infrastructure. Modern Platform Endorphins.

The most flexible and powerful compute platform on any public cloud. Fly Machines are hardware-virtualized containers, running on our own hardware, that launch instantly and run exactly as long as you want them to — for a single HTTP request, or for weeks of uptime.

- ## Get Right in Your Users' Faces




Deploy in 35 regions, from Sydney to São Paulo, for sub-100ms response times and native-app feel no matter where your users are.


- ## Fork Off VMs Like They're Processes




Fly Machines start fast enough to handle HTTP requests, run only when you need them, and scale into tens of thousands of instances.


- ## Ship GPU-Boosted Models




From LLMs to inferencing, hardware acceleration with the same developer experience as a simple CRUD app.


- ## Built for Distributed Systems




Clustered databases like Cockroach, globally-distributed Postgres, and modern RPC systems like Elixir FLAME, no Terraform required.

## Serverful JavaScript Without the Hassle of Serverless

Imagine if a server could boot as fast as a serverless function? That's Fly Machines—serverless compute is a trade-off you no longer need to make. Graduate to a full-stack cloud to regain control over your stack & hosting bill.


- ### Boots in 250ms or Less




Functions and apps boot and respond to web requests in 250ms or less with Fly Machines. You decide to keep them running or automatically put them to sleep.


- ### Built for JavaScript Developers




JavaScript, TypeScript, Bun, Deno—whatever your flavor, Fly Launch automatically detects your runtime and generates a VM with everything you need to run your app.


- ### Real GPUs & CPUs on the Edge




Run workloads that require GPUs or lots of CPUs, memory, and storage in over 30 regions around the world—all interconnected by a private, encrypted WireGuard network that works out of the box.
